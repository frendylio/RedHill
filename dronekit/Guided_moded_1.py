Fly a Square path using the standard Vehicle.simple_goto() method.

The method is called indirectly via a custom "goto" that allows the target position to be
specified as a distance in metres (North/East) from the current position, and which reports
the distance-to-target.

    Moves the vehicle to a position dNorth metres North and dEast metres East of the current position.
